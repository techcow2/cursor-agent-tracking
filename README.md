# Cursor Agent History Tracking System

## Overview
A simple system to maintain context and track changes in conversations with Cursor when it's in AGENT mode, ensuring continuity even if the AI 'forgets' previous interactions. This workaround isn't necessary for regular chat mode, as Cursor implements native tracking.

## Quick Start
1. Copy all `.md` files from the `templates` directory into your project's root directory:
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`
   - `PROMPT.md`

2. Begin every new chat with the AI by copying the contents of `PROMPT.md`
   - This ensures the AI has proper context about your project
   - The AI will maintain consistent formatting for changes
   - Track all significant changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Keep `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` updated with current status

## File Purposes
- `PROMPT.md`: Your template for starting each new chat session
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Tracks all significant changes to your project
- `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`: Maintains current project status and goals

## Best Practices
1. Always start new chats with the `PROMPT.md` template (this means every time you click the + symbol)
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` after significant changes
3. Keep `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` current
4. Include relevant file paths in your prompts
5. Save important code snippets and explanations

## Template Maintenance
Feel free to modify the templates to better suit your specific needs while maintaining the core structure for consistency.
